# Java + JavaScript for Markdown Parsing

This repository is a sample on how to use [unified.js](https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified) for parsing markdown from Java. It uses GraalVM's [Polyglot API](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/polyglot-programming/) to run JavaScript code from Java.

## Goal

The goal of this repository is to show that it's possible as one way to parse markdown in a unified way across frontend and backend using JavaScript.

The following table shows the distinctive possibilities on how to achieve this, where personally I prefer the way it is done in this repository (if markdown parsing has to happen in the backend):

## Setup

You need to be able to run the Java code using a GraalVM java executable and included JDK. This JDK is what provides the additional classes to run multiple languages using Truffle (the multilanguage framework).

The installation the GraalVM also has to include graal.js and graal.node in order to run the JavaScript code.

Steps:
- Install GraalVM with graal.js and graal.node (There's a VSCode Extension for easy management)
- Use the npm binary that is included in the GraalVM bin folder to run `npm install` in the src_js folder.
- Run `npm run build` in the src_js folder

Voil√°, now you're able to start the Java program, which should spit out formatted HTML.
